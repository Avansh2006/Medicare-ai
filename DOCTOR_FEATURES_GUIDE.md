## Database Requirements

### Sample Doctor Data
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- First, create a user profile with doctor role
INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, full_name, role) VALUES 
('doctor-uuid-1', 'doctor@example.com', 'Dr. John Smith', 'doctor');

-- Then create the doctor record
INSERT INTO doctors (profile_id, specialization, license_number, experience_years, consultation_fee, bio) VALUES 
('doctor-uuid-1', 'cardiology', 'MD123456', 10, 150.00, 'Experienced cardiologist specializing in heart disease treatment');
```

### Check Doctor Data
To verify doctors are in the database:
```sql
SELECT d.*, p.full_name, p.email 
FROM doctors d 
JOIN profiles p ON d.profile_id = p.id 
WHERE d.is_available = true;
```

## Console Debug Information

When testing, check the browser console for:
- Doctor fetching logs
- Appointment booking confirmations
- Authentication state changes
- Real-time appointment updates

## Navigation Updates
- **Doctors**: See Dashboard, Teleconsultation, Profile in navigation
- **Patients**: See standard patient navigation
- **Role Detection**: Automatic UI adaptation based on user role

## Known Limitations
- Video calling uses mock WebRTC (camera access only)
- Email invitations not yet implemented
- Real-time signaling needs WebSocket server setup

## Next Steps
1. Implement real WebRTC peer-to-peer connections
2. Add email invitation system for appointments
3. Enhance real-time notifications
4. Add prescription management
5. Implement payment processing for consultations
